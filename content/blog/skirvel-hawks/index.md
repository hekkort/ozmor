Messengers of the Sky Realms.

Skirvel Hawks are revered for their unerring sense of direction. These sleek, blue-plumed birds can travel 300 leagues without rest, guided by geomagnetic pulses. They are often trained by skyward couriers and used to deliver sealed messages between floating cities.

> "If a Skirvel takes flight with your words, know they will reach even the moonlight watchtowers." â€” *Skypost Lorebook*

- Can navigate even in magical fog or voidlight.

- Used in ancient High House diplomacy.

## Additional Lore

It is said that the first Skirvels were bred in the aeries of House Veyr, where they were infused with trace amounts of sky-metal to enhance their navigational senses. Some believe they can even detect lies, refusing to carry falsehoods. During the Siege of Aelarion, a single hawk named **Vareth's Wing** flew through storms and battlefields to deliver the call for aid â€” a journey now sung in bardic halls as *"The Last Flight of Dawn."*

Today, rogue hawks with broken bands are thought to carry forgotten secrets, flying endlessly between ruins, waiting for a true heir of the skies.
