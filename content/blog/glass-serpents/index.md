# 🐍 Glass Serpents

The Unseen Dangers.

Almost invisible against stone and sky, Glass Serpents are thin, translucent reptiles that coil around the high spires of Lorithal. They rely on vibration and heat to detect prey. Travelers are warned never to linger near spire vents after dusk.

## Known Traits

- Nearly undetectable unless disturbed.
- Can grow up to 15 meters in length.
- Said to guard ancient magic etched into the spires.

## Additional Lore

Legends say the Glass Serpents were not born — but **grown**, left behind by the Architect-Mages who shaped the floating cities. Their translucent bodies are not just camouflage, but vessels of old spells, some of which are still active. Those bitten sometimes vanish entirely, as if plucked from time.

Old texts from the House of Silence describe rituals to summon or repel them — involving mirrored surfaces, whispered numbers, and the burning of moon-lichen. A few daring scholars believe the serpents are not creatures at all, but remnants of failed illusions, granted form by ambient magic.

To meet one's reflection in the heights is to risk being replaced by it.
