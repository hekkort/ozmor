# 🐻 Gravetooth Bears

Keepers of the Crumbling Valleys.

Towering over men, the Gravetooth Bears are named for the jagged crystal formations growing from their jaws. Their roars echo for miles, capable of shaking boulders loose from cliff faces. Despite their fearsome appearance, they are fiercely territorial rather than bloodthirsty.

## Additional Lore

Gravetooth Bears are believed to be descendants of an ancient earth-spirit, bound to the land by the druids of the Second Cycle. The crystals in their jaws grow with age and serve as a measure of both status and power. Some claim these crystals absorb echoes — and when broken, they release the bear’s memories in haunting roars.

In rare cases, old Gravetooth dens have been found containing petrified cubs encased in quartz, untouched by time. One such den, discovered near the ruined Monastery of Qor, was said to cause madness in those who entered without offering a blood-tithe.
