Thank you again for your message!

My colleague has checked, and it appears you don’t yet have an Alpro SAP account.

You can request one using the following link:

In the meantime, I’ll forward your ticket to our IT experts so they can check whether you already have a Themis SAP account.

Kind regards,
Harry

## Mailbox MIM

Thank you for your message.

I've assigned you a license that enables access to the online version of Outlook. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the changes to fully propagate through the system.

## Non standard software request
- standaard bericht voor een non standard software req
Thank you for your response.

To proceed with this software request, we’ll need to follow the non-standard software request process, as this application isn’t part of our standard catalog. Please note that this process may take some time, as both the Security and Local IT teams will need to review and approve the software.

We’ve recently reinstated the review process for all non-standard software, which is why this step is required again.

To get started, could you please provide:

A business justification for needing the software
A download link from the original software vendor
Once we have this information, we can initiate the request.

Depending on your use case, you might also consider requesting Adobe Acrobat or Nuance PDF. These are licensed applications with associated costs but are already included in our standard software list.

Please let us know how you’d like to proceed.
Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,
Harry

If everything is functioning normally and you're connected to the VPN, the message may be due to a pending update and can be disregarded unless you experience issues.

## File paths
- file path too long
Thank you for your message.

Could you please share the full file path you're trying to access?

Keep in mind that the maximum length for a file path is 260 characters. If the path exceeds this limit, it may cause issues.

You might be able to resolve the problem by shortening the file name. Alternatively, renaming a folder higher up in the directory structure can help reduce the overall path length, making future file paths less prone to errors.

Let us know if any of these suggestions help!

Harry

## Meeting room
- how to book
You will sometimes see tickets with which a user is unable to book rooms see INC1887879 | Incident | eXcellence in Operations (service-now.com) for example. 
In that case, they are often new or haven't been added to the rooms list before.
What is important to check is to check if the user is from DPA. If that is the case, you can continue with granting them access.
If however the user is not from DPA then you should advise them to get in contact with the facilities team of DPA, as they manage outsiders to book rooms in DPA.
Their email is conferencecentre.dpa@danone.com.
