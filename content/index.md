# 🌍 The **Curious World of Lorithal**

Welcome to the ancient world of **Lorithal**, a land of forgotten ruins, whispering forests, and floating cities. This document explores its secrets.

## 🏰 The History

> “Even the stars remember Lorithal, though we have long forgotten her name.” — *Archivist Elen Taar*

Lorithal was once ruled by seven High Houses. The most powerful, **House Veyr**, built the Skyforge — a structure so vast it eclipsed the sun.

### Subsection: The Fall

In the year 8232 of the Third Cycle, the *Gloom Spires* erupted, casting ash across the continent. Survivors tell of a black-winged beast seen circling above the capital.


## 🐉 Creatures of the Realm

- **Skirvel Hawks**: Messengers that can travel 300 leagues without rest.
- **Gravetooth Bears**: Their roars shake stone.
- **Glass Serpents**: Almost invisible, they nest in the spires.


## 🧭 Artifacts & Relics

1. `Skyforge Compass`: Allows the user to find their way even in voidlight.
2. `Shard of Vael`: Said to contain a frozen moment in time. *Handle with caution.*
3. `Whispering Ring`: Still functional and Bound to the House of Silence.
