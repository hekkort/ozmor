## 🏰 The History

> “Even the stars remember Lorithal, though we have long forgotten her name.” — *Archivist Elen Taar*

Lorithal was once ruled by seven High Houses. The most powerful, **House Veyr**, built the Skyforge — a structure so vast it eclipsed the sun.

### Subsection: The Fall

In the year 8232 of the Third Cycle, the *Gloom Spires* erupted, casting ash across the continent. Survivors tell of a black-winged beast seen circling above the capital.

## 🐉 Creatures of the Realm

### 🦅 [Skirvel Hawks](/blog/skirvel-hawks)

- *Messengers of the Sky Realms*  
Skirvel Hawks are revered for their unerring sense of direction. These sleek, blue-plumed birds can travel 300 leagues without rest, guided by geomagnetic pulses. They are often trained by skyward couriers and used to deliver sealed messages between floating cities.

> "If a Skirvel takes flight with your words, know they will reach even the moonlight watchtowers." — *Skypost Lorebook*

### 🐻 [Gravetooth Bears](/blog/gravetooth-bears)

- *Keepers of the Crumbling Valleys*  
Towering over men, the Gravetooth Bears are named for the jagged crystal formations growing from their jaws. Their roars echo for miles, capable of shaking boulders loose from cliff faces. Despite their fearsome appearance, they are fiercely territorial rather than bloodthirsty.

> "When the valleys grumble, tread lightly — the Gravetooth watches." — *Ranger's Field Journal*

### 🐍 [Glass Serpents](/blog/glass-serpents)

- *The Unseen Dangers*  
Almost invisible against stone and sky, Glass Serpents are thin, translucent reptiles that coil around the high spires of Lorithal. They rely on vibration and heat to detect prey. Travelers are warned never to linger near spire vents after dusk.

> "I saw my reflection blink — and then it was gone." — *Last entry of Scribe Halen Mor*
