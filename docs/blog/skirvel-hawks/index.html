    <article><div><h1>ü¶Ö Skirvel Hawks</h1><p><img src=/ozmor/images/skirvel-hawk.png alt=Skirvel Hawk></img></p><h2>Messengers of the Sky Realms</h2><p>Skirvel Hawks are revered for their unerring sense of direction. These sleek, blue-plumed birds can travel 300 leagues without rest, guided by geomagnetic pulses. They are often trained by skyward couriers and used to deliver sealed messages between floating cities.</p><blockquote>"If a Skirvel takes flight with your words, know they will reach even the moonlight watchtowers." ‚Äî *Skypost Lorebook*</blockquote><p>---</p><h2>Known Traits</h2><ul><li>Can navigate even in magical fog or voidlight.</li><li>Form lifelong bonds with handlers.</li><li>Used in ancient High House diplomacy.</li><li>Sensitive to sky-metal and leyline interference.</li><li>Wings shimmer faintly under starlight due to trace celestial alloys.</li></ul><p>---</p><h2>Additional Lore</h2><p>It is said that the first Skirvels were bred in the aeries of <b>House Veyr</b>, where they were infused with trace amounts of sky-metal to enhance their navigational senses. These birds were once thought extinct following the <b>Fracture of the Aether Spine</b>, but rediscovered by storm-herders near the ruins of Cloudmere.</p><p>Legends hold that Skirvels do not serve just anyone ‚Äî they must first recognize a person‚Äôs "sky-thread," an unseen tether of purpose. If a hawk refuses a message, it is said to be fate itself intervening.</p><p>During the <b>Siege of Aelarion</b>, a single hawk named <b>Vareth's Wing</b> flew through storms and battlefields to deliver the call for aid ‚Äî a journey now sung in bardic halls as *"The Last Flight of Dawn."*</p><p>In modern times, rogue hawks with broken bands are believed to carry lost words: royal decrees, unsent warnings, even final confessions. These birds never land, circling the ruins of sky-cities long since fallen, seeking a true heir to the broken banners.</p><p>---</p><h2>Timeline of Flight and Folklore</h2><ul><li><b>-701 A.S.</b> ‚Äî First mention of ‚Äúsky-silvered hawks‚Äù in House Veyr breeding ledgers.</li><li><b>-345 A.S.</b> ‚Äî Skirvels used to negotiate the Treaty of the Seven Isles.</li><li><b>1 A.S.</b> ‚Äî Vareth‚Äôs Wing delivers final plea to the Aether Wardens.</li><li><b>98 A.S.</b> ‚Äî Scholar Eylin claims Skirvels avoid falsehood; sparks debate in the High Forums.</li><li><b>312 A.S.</b> ‚Äî A rogue hawk lands atop the Skygrave Tower, igniting prophecy rumors.</li></ul><p>---</p><h2>Bestiary Entry</h2><blockquote>*Class*: Arcane Avian</blockquote><blockquote>*Habitat*: Floating city aeries, high cliffs, ley-currents</blockquote><blockquote>*Temperament*: Loyal, alert, easily startled by distortion magic</blockquote><blockquote>*Threat Level*: Minimal (unless bonded and protective)</blockquote><blockquote>*Interaction Protocol*: Approach calmly; offer open hands and sky-metal token.
