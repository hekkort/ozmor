These sleek, blue-plumed birds can travel 300 leagues without rest, guided by geomagnetic pulses. They are often trained by skyward couriers and used to deliver sealed messages between floating cities.</p><blockquote>"If a Skirvel takes flight with your words, know they will reach even the moonlight watchtowers." â€” *Skypost Lorebook*</blockquote><h2>Known Traits</h2><ul><li>Can navigate even in magical fog or voidlight.</li><li>Form lifelong bonds with handlers.</li><li>Used in ancient High House diplomacy.</li></ul><h2>Additional Lore</h2><p>It is said that the first Skirvels were bred in the aeries of House Veyr, where they were infused with trace amounts of sky-metal to enhance their navigational senses. Some believe they can even detect lies, refusing to carry falsehoods. During the Siege of Aelarion, a single hawk named <b>Vareth's Wing</b> flew through storms and battlefields to deliver the call for aid â€” a journey now sung in bardic halls as *"The Last Flight of Dawn."*</p><p>Today, rogue hawks with broken bands are thought to carry forgotten secrets, flying endlessly between ruins, waiting for a true heir of the skies.</p></div></article>
